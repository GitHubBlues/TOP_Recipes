## Recipes

This project consists of a landing page with links to three pages, each with a simple recipe. The objective of this project was to put into practice what had been learned about HTML until that lesson. The page does not have any styping. 
The project is available at: https://githubblues.github.io/TOP_Recipes/.

This project was executed in the context of "The Odin Project" web-development course. A detailed description of the requirements to be met in this project is found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes.
